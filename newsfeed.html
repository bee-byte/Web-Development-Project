            Manchester United have assembled a provisional 29-man squad ahead of the possible restart 
            of the Premier League season next month.
            United reopened their Carrington training complex on Wednesday for players to begin phase one
            of training in anticipation of the season's likely resumption in June.
            Paul Pogba and Marcus Rashford have reported for sessions now they have recovered from long-term 
            injuries and manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has a fully-fit squad to choose from.
            The United squad could be trimmed if the club fails to agree an extension for the loan of Shanghai 
            Shenhua striker Odion Ighalo, whose contract expires on May 31. Angel Gomes is out of contract on June 
            30 and United have until June 23 to agree an extension until the end of the season with the 19-year-old.
            Meanwhile, United have been linked with Bayer Leverkusen star Kai Havertz who netted a brace against Borussia
            Monchengladbach on Saturday.</p>
